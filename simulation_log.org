We run the model with shorter time steps, because the higher ones that FS used (0.08) produced a lot of oscillations, the time step was only reduced after 600 steps if the model had not converged.
We want to see the qualitative fragmented manifold behavior of a manifold gradually deforming and relocalizing somewhere else.
